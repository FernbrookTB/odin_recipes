    </div>
        <p>Migas are a versatile dish with regional variations, but generally refer to a breakfast dish of crumbled corn tortillas or bread mixed with scrambled eggs. In Tex-Mex cuisine, migas are typically scrambled eggs cooked with fried corn tortilla pieces, cheese, onions, chili peppers, and tomatoes. Spanish and Portuguese migas often feature bread, olive oil, and various meats, but the Tex-Mex version is usually served with refried beans or potatoes and corn or flour tortillas.</p>
