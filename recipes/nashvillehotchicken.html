    <p>This Nashville Hot Chicken recipe is the best online! The trick to making it the authentic Nashville way is to build a super crispy batter that holds up to the coating of the spicy hot glaze without getting soggy. Nailing the textures and spices are essential, and I will show you how to do it the right way.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    </div> 
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chicken</strong> - You can easily use boneless chicken pieces or choose your favorite type of chicken including, breasts, thighs, tenders, and more! Based on my testing, know that you may need to adjust the cooking time.</li>
            <li><strong>Buttermilk</strong> - Swap in a DIY version by mixing 1 cup of milk with 1 tablespoon of white vinegar or lemon juice. Let it sit for about 5 minutes until it thickens slightly before using.</li>
            <li><strong>Hot Sauce</strong> - Sriracha can work if you absolutely cannot find hot sauce but it won’t be authentic.</li>
            <li><strong>Flour</strong> - You can also substitute with a good 1-to-1 gluten free option here.</li>
            <li><strong>Cornstarch</strong> - This helps our chicken get crispier when it fries. You can also leave out.</li>
            <li><strong>Seasoned Salt</strong> - Kosher salt also works but I would doctor it up so you don’t miss all the flavors.</li>
            <li><strong>Cayenne Pepper</strong> - You can use as much or as little as you can stand.</li>
            <li><strong>Brown Sugar</strong> - Granulated can also work or add molasses to granulated to make some homemade brown sugar.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
    </div>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together the buttermilk and hot sauce in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Mix the flour, cornstarch, seasoned salt, paprika, cayenne pepper, black pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder until well combined.</li>
            <li>Dip each piece of chicken into the seasoned flour.</li>
            <li>Transfer it to the buttermilk.</li>
            <li>Dip it the second time into the seasoned flour.</li>
            <li>Add each piece of chicken to a baking sheet to rest for 15-20 minutes to allow the coating time to set.</li>
            <li>Fry the chicken in 2 inches of oil in a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Fry four pieces at a time on each side. After each side has turned slightly golden, put the top on the skillet to steam the inside of the chicken ensuring doneness. After a couple of minutes, remove the top and continue to fry until the crust is crispy again.</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken from the oil and place it on paper towels or a rack to drain. Transfer the drained chicken to a warm oven to keep it warm while you continue cooking the remaining pieces of chicken.</li>
            <li>Whisk together a cup of the frying oil you used to fry the chicken with the cayenne pepper, brown sugar, chili powder, garlic powder, and smoked paprika.</li>
            <li>With the mixture you just created, coat the fried chicken until heavily sauced. If you have left overs of the seasoning mixture, coat the sauced chicken with it.</li>
        </ol>
