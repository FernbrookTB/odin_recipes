    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Nashville Hot Chicken recipe is the best online! The trick to making it the authentic Nashville way is to build a super crispy batter that holds up to the coating of the spicy hot glaze without getting soggy. Nailing the textures and spices are essential, and I will show you how to do it the right way.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2> 
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chicken</strong> - You can easily use boneless chicken pieces or choose your favorite type of chicken including, breasts, thighs, tenders, and more! Based on my testing, know that you may need to adjust the cooking time.</li>
            <li><strong>Buttermilk</strong> - Swap in a DIY version by mixing 1 cup of milk with 1 tablespoon of white vinegar or lemon juice. Let it sit for about 5 minutes until it thickens slightly before using.</li>
            <li><strong>Hot Sauce</strong> - Sriracha can work if you absolutely cannot find hot sauce but it won’t be authentic.</li>
            <li><strong>Flour</strong> - You can also substitute with a good 1-to-1 gluten free option here.</li>
            <li><strong>Cornstarch</strong> - This helps our chicken get crispier when it fries. You can also leave out.</li>
            <li><strong>Seasoned Salt</strong> - Kosher salt also works but I would doctor it up so you don’t miss all the flavors.</li>
            <li><strong>Cayenne Pepper</strong> - You can use as much or as little as you can stand.</li>
            <li><strong>Brown Sugar</strong> - Granulated can also work or add molasses to granulated to make some homemade brown sugar.</li>

        </ul>
